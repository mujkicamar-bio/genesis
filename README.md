# GENESIS

GENESIS is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts plasmid origin of replication (ORIV).  The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset derived from the OriGen project ((https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.03.636306v1). The goal is to enable computational classification of plasmid ORIV based only on DNA sequence.
